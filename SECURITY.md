## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

Please follow these steps for reporting a security vulnerability:

1. **Do Not Open a GitHub Issue**: To avoid public disclosure, do not report the vulnerability through GitHub Issues.
2. **Contact Us Directly**: Please send an email to [eimen.hamedat@gmail.com] with the subject "Security Vulnerability in ISAAC". Provide detailed information about the issue, including:
   - The version of the software that is affected.
   - A description of the vulnerability and potential impact.
   - Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept.
3. **Wait for Response**: We will acknowledge your email within [time frame, e.g., 48 hours]. After initial assessment, we will work with you to validate and address the vulnerability.
4. **Confidentiality**: Keep the information about any vulnerabilities you've discovered confidential between yourself and the project maintainers until we resolve the issue.

### Security Update Process

Once a security issue is reported, the following steps will be followed:
1. Confirmation of the problem and assessment of the impact.
2. Working on a fix, and a new release if necessary.
3. A public release of a security bulletin along with acknowledgments.

## Public Disclosure Timing

Public disclosure of the vulnerability will be made after the issue has been resolved. We aim to handle the vulnerability swiftly, but the timeline for public disclosure depends on the complexity of the issue.

## Acknowledgements

We appreciate your help in improving the security of [ISAAC](isaaceditor.com). After the issue is resolved, we would like to acknowledge your contribution in our release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
